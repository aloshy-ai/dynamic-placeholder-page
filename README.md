# Dynamic Placeholder Page

## How it works

This is a dynamic placeholder page that creates an engaging visual display by:

- Fetching random images from the Civitai API
- Displaying them with a smooth Ken Burns effect animation
- Adding a colorful gradient overlay
- Showing the domain name in large text
- Automatically rotating through images every 10 seconds
- Gracefully falling back to a default image if the API fails

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Place the index.html file in your web server's root directory
3. Optionally, customize the FALLBACK_IMAGE constant in the script to your preferred default image
4. The page will automatically display your domain name and start rotating through images
